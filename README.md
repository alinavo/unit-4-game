JavaScript
jQuery - JavaScript Library

In this assignment, we were required to create a fun and interactive game for web browsers. This time, the app must dynamically update the HTML with the jQuery library.

Instructions:

At the start of the game, you will be given a random number. This number will represent the number of points needed to defeat Lord Voldemrt.

Pictured are four horcruxes, items that will help defeat the Dark Lord. By clicking on a horcrux, you will add a specfiic amount of points. The points will go towards the points needed to win.

Lord Voldemort will be defeated when your total score matches the random number. However, he will still be in power if your total score goes above the random number.

Note, that the value of each horcrux is hidden from you until it is clicked.

As the game restarts, the value of the horcruxes will change.
